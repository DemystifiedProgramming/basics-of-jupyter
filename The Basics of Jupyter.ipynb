This is especially useful to use when you want to go over a code example or give detail to what it does. If it is embedded in HTML text you can give a code example better context than a simple comment. Below we import the sqrt method from the math module and use it in the distance function. At the end we print the distance of points (0, 0) and (1, 1). Double-click on the code example below to see how it works. Notice that the word \"python\" is next to the top \"```\". This can be changed out for C++, Java, or another language to use appropriate syntax highlighting. See the C++ version of our Python example below it.  Note that embedded code in markdown cannot be executed like normal code cells and are only for show.</p>"
